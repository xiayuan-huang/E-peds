# Family Pedigree Prediction

This algorithm is used to predict family pedigrees using basic demographic electronic health records data. We have publised a paper in Bioinformatics: ["Applying family analyses to electronic health
records to facilitate genetic research"](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/4/635/4158031). You can refer to the paper for the details of our algorithm.


## Running family pedigree prediction algorithm:

Our code is compatible with Marshfield Clinic Electronic Health Records system, it requires four input files:
  1. a
  2. b
